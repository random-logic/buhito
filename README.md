**buhito** is a Python library for enumerating graphlets and analyzing graphlet-based features from graphs. 

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lanl/buhito.git
cd buhito
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

### Enumerate graphlets with BFS

```python
import networkx as nx
from buhito import generate_subgraphs_breadthwise

G = nx.petersen_graph()

nx.set_node_attributes(G, {n: "C" for n in G.nodes}, "atom_key")
nx.set_edge_attributes(G, {e: "1" for e in G.edges}, "bond_key")

fp, bitinfo = generate_subgraphs_breadthwise(
    G,
    depth=4,
    return_nodewise=False,
    full_hash=True,
    node_key="atom_key",
    edge_key="bond_key"
)

print("Graphlet fingerprint length:", len(fp))
```

### Enumerate graphlets with DFS

```python
from buhito import generate_subgraphs_depthwise

subsets, counts = generate_subgraphs_depthwise(G, maxlen=4)
print("Found graphlet subsets:", len(subsets))
```

## Examples

Available example scripts:

- `examples/plotting_example.py` — visualize graphlets from the Petersen graph
- `examples/qm9/benchmark_graphlet_featurizers_train_test.py` — benchmark featurizers on QM9 chemical properties data
- `examples/reddit_example/reddit_graphlets_example.py` — network graphlet analysis for REDDIT-5K graphs

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Package structure

- `src/buhito/` — core features
- `src/buhito/converters.py` — converters to NetworkX graphs
- `src/buhito/plotting.py` — graphlet visualization helpers
